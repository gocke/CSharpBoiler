CSharpBoiler is a tool to see all your recent matches, comment on them and download the. More coming soon.


Note: The new matchdata filename should be: "accountid"_matchlist.dat, in the last releases it was "accountid".dat, you might have to rename. 
Reminder: copy your old one before renaming just to make sure there are no bugs and you lose your data. Next 100% Stable release will be marked.
